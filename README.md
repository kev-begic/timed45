# Timed 45

Survivor Michigan is an undergraduate organization based on CBS Competition Survivor! 
Timed 45 is a psychological immunity challenge that requries competitors to decide in fourty five minutes who wins immunity for the week. Similar to musical chairs, each round consists of seats survivors can only sit on when the timer is paused. The twist involves a person risking their seat on one of the chairs if they pause the timer. Each round has a chair removed such that there will always be one person who loses the round whenever the timer is paused. 

The project was created by Kevin Begic on February 23rd, 2019 for Survivor Michigan: Wolverine Wars.
